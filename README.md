# Dicom-Export-Sectra-Media
Extract DICOM files from a Sectra media export structure. Files are stored in folders named PatiendID and filenames created from StudyDate, StudyTime and Modality tag. Mainly for use to export images for analysis in non-DICOM applications.

# TODO
I will add several variants of the script which can be used to produce anonymized images and keyfiles for research.
